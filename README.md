# What is SuperMechs Workshop?

A **tool** for [Super Mechs](http://supermechs.com/) players to build and test mechs using every premium item and more.


# Why?

Grinding resources, buying lootboxes to get premium items and upgrading those items is time-consuming, SuperMechs Workshop was made for people who don't want to wait any longer to test their million dollar mech ideas. 


# Technologies

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Because we have no time to waste fixing type errors, catching them before they go to production is a must.

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - While still new, Svelte showed great potential for app-like websites, it is incredibly performant and easy to use at the same time, and for that, it replaced the previously used React in this project.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - It's *Lightning Fast* Hot Module Replacement (HMR), instant build times and for forethinking the concept of bundling itself.


# Features

- Unlimited access to every useful item in the game, including premium items.
- Save and load multiple mech setups.
- View the mech you're building and the stats for it. (Arena Buffs included)
- Support for custom item packs, so you try your own items and balance changes.
- An online battle simulator so you can actually test your mechs.
